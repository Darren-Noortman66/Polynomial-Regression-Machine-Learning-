# Polynomial-Regression-Machine-Learning-
A machine learning program made using the Python language and the polynomial regression method.

## This project is used to determine the price for pizza depending on its diameter.


* **What is this repo or project?**

     This project runs an application named 'poly' which is used to determine the prices for pizzas depending on their diameter. After executing the program
* **How does it work?**

    This project is made using Python, and the machine-learning method used is polynomial-regression. This means the prices for the pizzas are all dependent on the pizza's diameter. The machine is 'taught' how to respond to the data it will recieve through a training and testing set. A figure will appear when the program is executed. Below this figure you will see controls on how to manipulate the graph.
* **Who will use this repo or project?**

    This project is used to showcase my understanding of Machine-Learning. I just used pizzas as a fun example. :D
* **What is the goal of this project?**
    
    The main goal of this task was to practice machine-learning. The program is made to 'learn' from the data it is given in order to determine the pizzas' prices from their diameter. Executing this program will display a figure showing the information on the diameters and prices. 


## How to Develop, Use, and Test the code.

Firstly, you will need to install an IDE/ IDLE that can run .java files, such as IntelliJ. (If you don't have one installed.)
Once you have the IDE/ IDLE setup, then run the 'Poised.java' file. This is the main-driver file for running the program. When the file has been opened, then run / execute the program.

Now that you have the program running, you will have options/ instructions printed on the screen for you. Choose amongst these options to work with the program as you wish. Each option will provide you with information needed to add/ manipulate projects. Be sure to first add a project before trying to manipulate it as this will cause an error.

To test your input/ code, you can look at the output printed on the screen to see if the information inserted is correct.


## How you can help

No help is needed right now, as this project is complete. However, if you do see improvements that can be made, then please feel free to point them out :D
