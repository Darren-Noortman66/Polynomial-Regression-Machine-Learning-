# Polynomial-Regression-Machine-Learning-
A machine learning program made using the Python language and the polynomial regression method.

## This project is used to determine the price for pizza depending on its diameter.


* **What is this repo or project?**

     This project runs an application named 'poly' which is used to determine the prices for pizzas depending on their diameter. After executing the program
* **How does it work?**

    This project is made using Python, and the machine-learning method used is polynomial-regression. This means the prices for the pizzas are all dependent on the pizza's diameter. The machine is 'taught' how to respond to the data it will recieve through a training and testing set. A figure will appear when the program is executed. Below this figure you will see controls on how to manipulate the graph.
* **Who will use this repo or project?**

    This project is used to showcase my understanding of Machine-Learning. I just used pizzas as a fun example. :D
* **What is the goal of this project?**
    
    The main goal of this task was to practice machine-learning. The program is made to 'learn' from the data it is given in order to determine the pizzas' prices from their diameter. Executing this program will display a figure showing the information on the diameters and prices. 


## How to Develop, Use, and Test the code.

Firstly, you will need to install an IDE/ IDLE that can run .py, such as PyCharm. (If you don't have one installed.)
Once you have the IDE/ IDLE setup, then run the 'task_manager.py' file. This is the execution file for the program. When the file has been opened, then run / execute the program.

Once the program is executed, a figure will appear dispaying the information gathered by the machine. Below this figure you will see controls on how to manipulate the graph.


## How you can help

No help is needed right now, as this project is complete. However, if you do see improvements that can be made, then please feel free to point them out :D
